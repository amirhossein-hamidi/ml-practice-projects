Projects
1. Simple Linear Regression

A single-feature regression example predicting purchase amounts based on page speed.

Implements:

Data generation and splitting into training and test sets

Regression using scipy.stats.linregress

Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R²

Visualizations:

Scatter plot with regression line

Test vs predicted values

Residual plot

2. Multiple Linear Regression with Standardization

A multi-feature regression example predicting sales based on advertising spend (total and social media).

Implements:

Data generation with two correlated features

Standardization using StandardScaler

Regression using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression

Evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, R²

Visualizations:

Scatter plot of test data vs predicted values

Residual plot
